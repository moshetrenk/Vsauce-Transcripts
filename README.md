# Vsauce-Transcripts    
The good people at https://sites.google.com/site/vsaucetranscripts/contact-me have transcripted some of Vsauce's videos. This puts a local copy of all currently available transcripts into a folder on the user's desktop called "Vsauce Transcripts" and each transcript is a .txt named with the title of the video. It's somewhat versatile- even if the site changes a bit, it should still work with a few exceptions that can be easily fixed as they come. Considering nobody is ever going to use this except me, that's all good and well.
