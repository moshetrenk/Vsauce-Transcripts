# Vsauce-Transcripts    
The good people at https://sites.google.com/site/vsaucetranscripts/contact-me have transcripted some of Vsauce's videos. This put a local copy of all currently available transcripts into a folder on the user's desktop called "Vsauce Transcripts" and each transcript is a .txt named with the title of the video.
