# Vsauce-Transcripts    
The good people at https://sites.google.com/site/vsaucetranscripts/contact-me have transcripted some of Vsauce's videos. This puts a local copy of all currently available transcripts into a folder on the user's desktop called "Vsauce Transcripts" and each transcript is a .txt named with the title of the video. It's somewhat versatile- even if the site changes a bit, it should still work with a few exceptions that can be easily fixed as they come. Considering nobody is ever going to use this except me, that's all good and well.      
Note: this will only work if every video starts with "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here." and ends with "And as always, thanks for watching.", if anything changes, even a comma/period, it won't work.      
In English, this is pretty much what happens: The entire homepage is downloaded into a single string, each link is extracted from the string (identified by "a href = ""..." and "jotId') and then put together into a list of good URLs. Then each URL's html is downloaded and cut down from the "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here." until "And as always, thanks for watching.", then finally the html/css is stripped off and it's sent to a text file
